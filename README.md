# Tools

This is a collection of local tools for RHEL8 using podman. Most of this should also work for Docker, save a few commands in the shell scripts, .zsh files and aliases.

## ZSH

ZSH is currently being used with `FiraMono Nerd Font`

## TODO: Move Rhel8 remote to own repo

The remote RHEL 8 Docker image is based off of [JUMP-RHEL by Venera-13](https://github.com/venera-13/jump-rhel)
